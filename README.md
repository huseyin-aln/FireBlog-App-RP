## Acknowledgements
- This project is built using React and "rapidapi.com/KishCom/api/covid-19-coronavirus-statistics/" API.
- When the relevant country is clicked on a world map, the number of confirmed cases of covid 19, the number of deaths and recoveries, and the updated date 
information for the relevant country are displayed on another page.
- The name of the relevant country is entered into the input on the main page, and the data of that country comes on a different page.
- Loader is used in waiting for data from API.
- In cases where the relevant country data cannot be obtained from the API, the user is informed.
- Some unit tests have been written for Navbar and Footer components using the cypress library.
- Responsive design is provided on the compatibility side.
